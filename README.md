This is a "proxy" repository that allows building Pine64 u-boot with [Armbian build script](https://github.com/igorpecovnik/lib)

Build process is based on work of [longsleep](https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image/tree/master/u-boot-postprocess), [apritzel](https://github.com/apritzel/pine64) and other members of linux-sunxi community.
